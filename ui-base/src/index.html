                This is a sample page that serves as a quick way to see all common components.  It can also be used as a reference in development while developing individual components.

                Given more time this role should probably be relegated to something like <a href="https://github.com/frctl" target="_blank">Fractal</a> but for now this is usable.

            <section id="grid">
                <h2>Grid</h2>
                I'm trying something new (to me) here and using a grid that does not require the use of css classes to define layout.  In order to define a component's width on the page, simply import the <code>grid</code> file and then define your widths using the shorthand defined <a href="http://susy.readthedocs.io/shorthand/">here</a>.

                This was done partly as a learning exercise but also because I think that the type of content we'll be serving up will benefit from an approach like this in terms of accessibility, SEO, and long-term maintainance by creating cleaner html markup.
